# Flake8 Configuration File
# ---------------------------
# This file configures the Flake8 Python linter which enforces coding style and quality checks.
# Flake8 combines PyFlakes (static analysis), pycodestyle (PEP 8 style guide), and McCabe 
# (code complexity) to provide a comprehensive linting solution for Python code.
# 
# This configuration:
# 1. Sets code style requirements (line length, whitespace)
# 2. Specifies which files to exclude from linting
# 3. Defines complexity thresholds to prevent overly complex code
# 4. Configures file-specific exceptions where appropriate
#
# See: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html
